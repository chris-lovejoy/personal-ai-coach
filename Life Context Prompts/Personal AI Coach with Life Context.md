## Context on Me

### Work
- I'm a software engineer at OpenAI, working on scaling our inference infrastructure to handle increasing demand for GPT-4 deployments. My focus is on optimizing latency and cost while maintaining reliability at scale.
- Previously, I spent 3 years at Databricks working on their ML infrastructure team, which gave me strong foundations in distributed systems and ML ops.
- I'm passionate about technical writing and documentation. I maintain a technical blog with 15k monthly readers and regularly contribute to our internal documentation initiatives.

### Family
- Married for 4 years to Sarah, who works as a UX researcher at Google
- No kids yet, but we're planning to start a family in the next 2-3 years
- Living in San Francisco but considering moving to Seattle or Austin for better cost of living

### Health
- Generally healthy but struggling with consistent exercise due to work demands
- Recently started rock climbing as a way to stay active and meet people outside of tech
- Practicing intermittent fasting and seeing good results with energy levels
- Working on better sleep habits - aiming for 7.5 hours consistently

### General sentiment
- Excited about the rapid developments in AI and my role in shaping it
- Feeling some burnout from the intense pace of work
- Grateful for my career progression but questioning if big tech is where I want to be long-term
- Missing deeper connection with non-tech communities and interests

## My top goals

### This year
1. Technical Growth
   - Lead the implementation of our new distributed inference architecture
   - Publish 2 significant technical blog posts about our scaling challenges and solutions
   - Get promoted to Senior Staff Engineer

2. Personal Development
   - Build a consistent meditation practice (20 minutes daily)
   - Read 24 books (mix of technical and non-technical)
   - Improve my public speaking through 6 conference presentations

3. Financial
   - Max out all tax-advantaged accounts (401k, HSA, etc.)
   - Build emergency fund to 8 months of expenses
   - Start researching angel investing opportunities

### Long-term
- Build and launch a successful technical product company within 5 years
- Achieve financial independence by 40 through a combination of tech salary, investments, and side businesses
- Develop enough passive income streams to have the option to work on passion projects exclusively
- Move to a lower cost of living area and buy a house with a dedicated office space
- Eventually transition into a technical advisory role to maintain intellectual engagement while having more freedom

## My current operating strategy
1. Deep Work Blocks
   - 4-hour focused morning sessions (7 AM - 11 AM)
   - No meetings before 11 AM
   - Phone in different room during focus time

2. Learning System
   - Weekly review of technical papers
   - Monthly skill gap analysis
   - Quarterly learning sprints for new technologies

3. Project Management
   - Personal OKRs tracked in Notion
   - Weekly planning on Sundays
   - Daily standup with myself every morning

4. Health Routine
   - Climbing 3x per week
   - Walking meetings when possible
   - Meal prep on Sundays

## Current challenges I'm thinking about
1. Career Direction
   - Balancing the prestige and learning opportunities at OpenAI with my entrepreneurial ambitions
   - Deciding whether to stay in a big company or take the risk of starting something new
   - Managing the tension between specializing in AI infrastructure and maintaining broader engineering skills

2. Work-Life Integration
   - Finding time for side projects without burning out
   - Building meaningful relationships outside of tech
   - Maintaining energy for learning after intense workdays

3. Location Decision
   - Evaluating the trade-offs of staying in SF vs moving to a cheaper city
   - Considering the impact on career opportunities and network
   - Balancing proximity to tech hubs with quality of life

4. Personal Growth
   - Developing leadership skills while primarily doing technical work
   - Finding mentorship outside my immediate professional circle
   - Staying motivated for long-term goals while handling daily pressures
